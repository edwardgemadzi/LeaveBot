# Network Error Fix Summary

## 🎯 Current Status: **Code Ready, Awaiting Deployment**

### The Network Errors You're Seeing

When you open **Users Management** or **Teams Management**, you see:
- ❌ "Failed to load data"
- ❌ Network errors in console

**Root Cause:** Vercel hasn't deployed your latest code yet.

## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. API Consolidation (Main Issue)
**Problem:** You had 13 serverless functions → exceeds Vercel Hobby limit of 10

**Solution:** Consolidated to 6 functions:
```
✅ api/users.js      (was 3 files: users/index, users/[id], users/create)
✅ api/teams.js      (was 5 files: teams/index, teams/[id], teams/[id]/assign, etc.)
✅ api/leaves.js
✅ api/login.js
✅ api/register.js
✅ api/balance.js
```

### 2. Interactive Calendar (Your Request)
**Added Features:**
- ✅ Click and drag to select date ranges
- ✅ '+' Request Leave button for quick access
- ✅ Fixed end date highlighting (now includes last day)
- ✅ Team view toggle for leaders
- ✅ Color-coded events:
  - 🟢 Green = Your leaves
  - 🔵 Blue = Team leaves
  - 🟡 Amber = Pending requests
  - 🔴 Red = Rejected requests

### 3. Pending Leaves Visibility (Your Request)
**Fixed:** Calendar now shows ALL leaves, including pending ones
- Before: Only showed approved leaves
- After: Shows approved, pending, and rejected (color-coded)

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Check Vercel Deployment (2-5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your **LeaveBot** project
3. Check the "Deployments" tab
4. Look for the latest commit: `0861f31` or `78d68ed`
5. Wait for status: **Building** → **Ready** ✅

### Step 2: Test Once Deployed

**Users Management:**
- Open Users Management
- Should see list of users (no "failed to load" error)
- Try: Create user, Edit user, Delete user

**Teams Management:**
- Open Teams Management  
- Should see list of teams (no "failed to load" error)
- Try: Create team, Assign user, Remove user

**Interactive Calendar:**
- Click and drag on calendar to select dates
- Click "Request Leave" on the popup
- Verify dates are pre-filled in the form
- Check that pending leaves show in amber color
- If you're a leader, toggle "Show team leaves only"

## 🔍 If Still Seeing Errors After 10 Minutes

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click your latest deployment
3. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 2: CLI Deploy
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Check Browser Cache
- Hard reload: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows)
- Or open DevTools → Network tab → Check "Disable cache"

## 📊 Technical Details

### API Changes
**Old Routes (deleted):**
- `/api/users/index` → 404
- `/api/users/[id]` → 404
- `/api/users/create` → 404
- `/api/teams/[id]/assign` → 404

**New Routes (deployed after Vercel build):**
- `/api/users` → handles all user operations
- `/api/teams` → handles all team operations

**How They Work:**
```javascript
// Get all users
GET /api/users

// Get specific user
GET /api/users?id=123

// Create user
POST /api/users

// Update user
PUT /api/users?id=123

// Delete user
DELETE /api/users?id=123

// Assign user to team
POST /api/teams?id=456&action=assign

// Remove user from team
POST /api/teams?id=456&action=remove
```
