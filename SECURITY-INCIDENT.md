# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT

## Incident Summary
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Type:** Exposed Secrets in Git Repository

---

## What Was Exposed

### Commit: `03b9e45` - "üìñ Add production deployment guide"
**File:** `DEPLOYMENT.md`

#### Exposed Credentials:
1. **MongoDB Connection String**
   - Username: `leavebot`
   - Password: `9qGsGyP1btSulfF8`
   - Cluster: `leavebot.kih8gyg.mongodb.net`
   - Full URI: `mongodb+srv://leavebot:9qGsGyP1btSulfF8@leavebot.kih8gyg.mongodb.net/leavebot?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=leavebot`

2. **JWT Secret**
   - Exposed value: `0f9OBraUVEirfoYezCvxKkA0sqmLl1tzeB/DS+r815A=`

---

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ 1. Sanitized Repository (Commit `59bc704`)
- Replaced real credentials with placeholders in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Pushed security fix to GitHub
- Credentials no longer visible in latest commit

### ‚úÖ 2. Generated New JWT Secret
- New secret: `ytd5zFBUV9AXM/f48yC4sWUqjn0n6XPRUDrqzBNEHng=`
- Ready to replace exposed secret

---

## üî¥ URGENT: Actions You Must Take NOW

### 1. Reset MongoDB Password (CRITICAL - Do First!)

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Navigate to: **Database Access**
3. Find user: **`leavebot`**
4. Click **"Edit"**
5. Click **"Edit Password"**
6. Generate new password: **"Autogenerate Secure Password"**
7. **COPY THE NEW PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY**
8. Click **"Update User"**

### 2. Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to: **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí LeaveBot ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

**Update these:**
```bash
# Delete old values and add new ones

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://leavebot:<NEW_PASSWORD_FROM_ATLAS>@leavebot.kih8gyg.mongodb.net/leavebot?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=leavebot

JWT_SECRET=ytd5zFBUV9AXM/f48yC4sWUqjn0n6XPRUDrqzBNEHng=
```

### 3. Update Local .env File

Update your local `.env` file with:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://leavebot:<NEW_PASSWORD_FROM_ATLAS>@leavebot.kih8gyg.mongodb.net/leavebot?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=leavebot

JWT_SECRET=ytd5zFBUV9AXM/f48yC4sWUqjn0n6XPRUDrqzBNEHng=
```

### 4. Redeploy Application

After updating Vercel environment variables:
```bash
# Option 1: Trigger redeploy in Vercel Dashboard
Go to Deployments ‚Üí Click "..." ‚Üí Redeploy

# Option 2: Push empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Redeploy with rotated credentials"
git push
```

### 5. Test Application

After redeployment:
1. Try logging in with existing users
2. If login fails, existing JWT tokens are invalid (expected)
3. Users will need to log in again
4. Test creating new leave requests

---

## Why This Happened

The `DEPLOYMENT.md` file was created as a helpful deployment guide but **included actual production credentials instead of placeholders**. This is a common mistake when documenting deployment steps.

---

## Prevention Measures

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented:
- `.env` file in `.gitignore` (local secrets never committed)
- `.env.example` uses placeholders only
- Security documentation emphasizes secret management

### üîí Additional Safeguards:
1. **Never commit real credentials** - Always use placeholders like:
   - `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster>`
   - `YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE`
   - `generate-with-openssl`

2. **Review commits before pushing** - Check for:
   - Connection strings with real passwords
   - API keys, tokens, secrets
   - Email addresses, phone numbers

3. **Use environment variables only** - Credentials should only exist in:
   - Local `.env` (gitignored)
   - Vercel Environment Variables
   - MongoDB Atlas settings

4. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning** (if not already enabled)
   - Go to: Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Secret scanning
   - Enable alerts for exposed secrets

---

## Impact Assessment

### Potential Access:
- ‚ùå Anyone who viewed commit `03b9e45` could access your MongoDB database
- ‚ùå Anyone with the JWT secret could forge authentication tokens
- ‚ùå Commit is in public GitHub history (if repo is public)

### Data at Risk:
- User accounts and passwords (hashed with bcrypt - still secure)
- Leave requests and personal information
- Admin access to the system

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Credentials removed from latest commit
- ‚è≥ Old credentials still work until rotated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Historical commits still contain exposed secrets

---

## Git History Cleanup (Optional but Recommended)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This rewrites Git history and requires force push. Coordinate with team if working with others.

```bash
# Remove sensitive commit from history
git rebase -i 03b9e45^

# In the editor, change "pick" to "drop" for commit 03b9e45
# Save and exit

# Force push (DANGEROUS - only if you're the only developer)
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Alternative (Safer):** Leave history as-is since credentials will be rotated. The exposed credentials become useless once changed.

## Checklist

### Immediate (Do Now):
- [ ] Reset MongoDB password in Atlas
- [ ] Update `MONGODB_URI` in Vercel with new password
- [ ] Update `JWT_SECRET` in Vercel with new secret
- [ ] Update local `.env` with new credentials
- [ ] Redeploy application
- [ ] Test login and functionality

### Follow-up (Next 24 Hours):
- [ ] Monitor MongoDB Atlas for suspicious access
- [ ] Review Vercel logs for unauthorized requests
- [ ] Check if GitHub repo is public (consider making private)
- [ ] Enable GitHub Secret Scanning alerts
- [ ] Document incident in security log

### Long-term:
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks to detect secrets
- [ ] Regular security audits of documentation
- [ ] Team training on secret management
- [ ] Consider using secret management tools (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

## Contact

If you notice any suspicious activity:
1. Check MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí Connections
2. Check Vercel ‚Üí Logs for unusual requests
3. Immediately rotate credentials again if breach confirmed

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use placeholders in documentation** - Even helpful guides can leak secrets
2. **Review before committing** - Check each file for sensitive data
3. **Secrets belong in environment variables** - Never in code or docs
4. **Enable automated scanning** - Catch issues before they reach production
5. **Have an incident response plan** - Quick action minimizes damage

---

**Status:** Partially Resolved  
**Next Step:** Rotate MongoDB password and JWT secret in production  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Complete within 1 hour  

---

## New JWT Secret (Save This Securely)
```
ytd5zFBUV9AXM/f48yC4sWUqjn0n6XPRUDrqzBNEHng=
```

Use this to replace the exposed JWT_SECRET in Vercel.
