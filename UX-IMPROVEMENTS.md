# UX Improvements - Calendar Interactivity & Notifications
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## 🎯 **IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Interactive Calendar Date Selection** ✅

#### Before:
- Users had to manually type dates in form
- No visual date selection
- Separate "Request Leave" button outside calendar

#### After:
- **Click and drag on calendar** to select leave dates
- Automatically opens request modal with dates pre-filled
- Instant visual feedback with toast notification
- Seamless workflow from calendar to request

#### User Flow:
```
1. User views calendar
2. Clicks and drags to select dates (e.g., Dec 25-27)
3. Toast shows: "Selected: Dec 25, 2024 - Dec 27, 2024. Opening request form..."
4. Modal opens with dates pre-filled
5. User enters reason and submits
```

#### Implementation Details:
- **File:** `src/components/InteractiveCalendar.tsx`
- **Function:** `handleSelectSlot()`
- **Features:**
  - ✅ Only allows regular users to select (admins/leaders can't request)
  - ✅ Shows friendly toast message with selected dates
  - ✅ Auto-fills start/end dates in modal
  - ✅ Calendar remains selectable with `selectable` prop

---

### **2. Auto-Dismissing Toast Notifications** ✅

#### Before:
- Used `alert()` popups that require manual closing
- Blocking UI interruptions
- Poor UX for frequent actions

#### After:
- **Toast notifications** that auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Non-blocking UI
- Can be manually closed with X button
- Better visual design with icons and colors

#### Toast Types:
| Type | Icon | Color | Duration | Use Case |
|------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Success ✅ | CheckCircle | Green | 5s | Leave submitted, approved |
| Error ❌ | XCircle | Red | 5s | Failed requests, errors |
| Info ℹ️ | Info | Blue | 5s | Date selection, updates |
| Warning ⚠️ | AlertCircle | Amber | 5s | Conflicts, limits |

#### Examples:
```typescript
// When clicking on a leave event
showToast('John Doe • Dec 25-27 • APPROVED • Holiday vacation')

// When selecting dates
showToast('Selected: Dec 25, 2024 - Dec 27, 2024. Opening request form...')

// When admin/leader tries to select dates
showToast('Only regular users can request leaves. Admins and leaders manage team members.')
```

#### Implementation Details:
- **File:** `src/components/InteractiveCalendar.tsx`
- **Hook:** `useToast()` already in App.tsx
- **Component:** `Toast.tsx` (already existed)
- **Changes:**
  - Replaced `alert()` with `showToast()` in `handleSelectEvent()`
  - Added toast feedback in `handleSelectSlot()`
  - Passed `showToast` callback from App.tsx

---

### **3. Smart Calendar Behavior** ✅

#### Role-Based Interactions:

**Regular Users (role = 'user'):**
- ✅ Can click/drag to select dates
- ✅ Opens request modal automatically
- ✅ Calendar is fully interactive
- ✅ Sees "Click and drag to select dates" instruction

**Admins & Leaders (role = 'admin' | 'leader'):**
- ❌ Cannot select dates (they don't request leaves)
- ✅ Can view team schedules
- ✅ Can click events to see details
- ✅ Sees "View team leave schedules" instruction
- 🛡️ Protected: Shows toast if they try to select dates
