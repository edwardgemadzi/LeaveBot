## 1. Dashboard.tsx (655 lines) - HIGH PRIORITY

### Current Issues
- **Mixed responsibilities**: Stats calculation, data filtering, UI rendering, API calls, modal management
- **Large event handlers**: `handleLeaveAction` with 70+ lines of logic
- **Duplicated status badge logic**: StatusBadge component defined inline
- **Complex state management**: 5 state variables for modal and error handling
- **Inline components**: StatCard and StatusBadge defined at bottom of file

### File Structure Analysis
```
Lines 1-26:    State declarations (6 state variables)
Lines 27-96:   handleLeaveAction - API calls and error handling (70 lines)
Lines 97-105:  handlePasswordOverride - Password validation
Lines 106-113: cancelOverride - Reset state
Lines 114-121: calculateDaysForLeave - Utility function
Lines 122-165: stats calculation - useMemo with complex logic (44 lines)

### File Structure Analysis
```
Lines 1-15:    Interface and component setup
Lines 16-80:   Data loading and team selection
Lines 81-150:  Form submission handler
Lines 151-403: Form JSX (250 lines)
  - Team selection (40 lines)
  - Settings form (210 lines)
```

### Refactoring Recommendation
**Low priority** - File is manageable at 403 lines and has clear structure. If refactoring:
- Could reuse form sections from `TeamSettingsModal`
- Extract team selection into separate component
- Create `useTeamLeaveSettings` hook

### Expected Results (if refactored)

3. Update main component to use new pieces
4. Test thoroughly in browser
5. Update imports in parent components
6. Commit changes

# Example for Dashboard:
git checkout -b refactor/dashboard
# ... create files ...
npm run dev
# ... test in browser ...
git add .
git commit -m "♻️ Refactor Dashboard: 655 → 150 lines (77% reduction)"
git push
```
