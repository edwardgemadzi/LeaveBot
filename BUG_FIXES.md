# üêõ Bug Fixes - Data Display Issues

## Issues Identified

### 1. Leaders Not Seeing Team Leave Requests ‚ùå
**Problem**: Leaders were only seeing their own leave requests instead of all team members' requests.

**Root Cause**: In `Dashboard.tsx`, the `upcomingLeaves` calculation was filtering leaves to show only the leader's own leaves:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Bug):
if (user.role !== 'admin') {
  filteredLeaves = leaves.filter(l => l.userId === user.id)
}
// This excluded leaders from seeing team leaves
```

**Fix Applied**: Updated the filter logic to include leaders:
```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed):
if (user.role !== 'admin' && user.role !== 'leader') {
  filteredLeaves = leaves.filter(l => l.userId === user.id)
}
// Now leaders see all team leaves (backend already filters by team)
```

**File Changed**: `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` (line ~163)

### 2. Leave Balance Not Updating After Settings Changes ‚ùå
**Problem**: When users updated their shift pattern/time settings, the leave balance display didn't refresh to show recalculated values.

**Root Cause**: 
1. `LeaveBalance` component only refetches when `userId` changes (not when settings change)
2. Settings update doesn't trigger leave refetch in parent component

**Fix Applied**:

#### Part A: Enhanced LeaveBalance Component
Added optional `refreshKey` prop to allow external refresh triggering:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
interface LeaveBalanceProps {
  userId: string
  token: string
}
export function LeaveBalance({ userId, token }: LeaveBalanceProps) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBalance()
  }, [userId])  // Only userId as dependency
}

// AFTER:
interface LeaveBalanceProps {
  userId: string
  token: string
  refreshKey?: string | number  // NEW: Optional refresh trigger
}
export function LeaveBalance({ userId, token, refreshKey }: LeaveBalanceProps) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBalance()
  }, [userId, refreshKey])  // Now also refetches when refreshKey changes
}
```

**File Changed**: `src/components/LeaveBalance.tsx` (lines 11-22)

#### Part B: Refetch Leaves After Settings Update
Updated `App.tsx` to refetch leaves when user settings are successfully saved:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
onSuccess={() => {
  success('Settings updated successfully!')
  setShowProfileSettings(false)
}}

// AFTER:
onSuccess={() => {
  success('Settings updated successfully!')
  setShowProfileSettings(false)
  // Refetch leaves to update balance calculations
  refetchLeaves()
}}
```

**File Changed**: `src/App.tsx` (line ~372)

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Leader Viewing Team Leaves
1. ‚úÖ **Login as a leader**
2. ‚úÖ **Navigate to Dashboard**
3. ‚úÖ **Check "Upcoming Approved Leaves" section**
   - Should show all team members' upcoming leaves (not just leader's own)
4. ‚úÖ **Check "Recent Activity" section**
   - Should show all team members' recent requests
5. ‚úÖ **Navigate to "All Requests" tab**
   - Should show all team leave requests

### Test 2: Leave Balance Updates After Settings Change
1. ‚úÖ **Login as a regular user**
2. ‚úÖ **View Dashboard** - Note the current leave balance
3. ‚úÖ **Click "Settings" button** in header
4. ‚úÖ **Change shift pattern** (e.g., from Regular to 2-2-3 rotation)
5. ‚úÖ **Save settings**
6. ‚úÖ **Verify success toast** appears
7. ‚úÖ **Check Dashboard** - Leave balance should recalculate based on new settings
   - Working days used may change
   - Available days may change
   - Progress bar should update

### Test 3: Edge Cases
1. ‚úÖ **Leader with no team members**
   - Should see own leaves (no error)
2. ‚úÖ **Settings update while leaves are loading**
   - Should handle gracefully
3. ‚úÖ **Multiple rapid settings changes**
   - Should show latest values

## Backend Behavior (Unchanged)

The backend was already correctly filtering leaves:
- **Admin**: Sees ALL leaves across all teams
- **Leader**: Sees only their team's leaves (filtered by `leaderId` ‚Üí `teamId` ‚Üí `teamMembers`)
- **User**: Sees all teammates' leaves for calendar visibility

**Backend Code Reference**: `/api/leaves.js` ‚Üí `getAllLeaves()` function in `/lib/shared/mongodb-storage.js` (lines 200-260)

---

## Impact Analysis

### Lines Changed: 3 files, ~15 lines total
1. `src/components/Dashboard.tsx`: 3 lines (filter logic)
2. `src/components/LeaveBalance.tsx`: 8 lines (interface + useEffect)
3. `src/App.tsx`: 3 lines (refetch on success)

### Risk Assessment: LOW ‚úÖ
- Changes are isolated and minimal
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible (refreshKey is optional)
- Backend unchanged (already working correctly)

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Leaders can now properly monitor team leaves
- ‚úÖ Leave balance reflects current settings in real-time
- ‚úÖ Better user experience (no manual refresh needed)
- ‚úÖ Data consistency across UI

## Related Components

### Components That Display Leave Data:
1. **Dashboard.tsx** ‚úÖ Fixed
   - Statistics cards
   - Upcoming leaves
   - Recent activity
   
2. **App.tsx** (All Requests tab) ‚úÖ Already working
   - Uses same `leaves` array from `useLeaves` hook
   - Backend filtering handles leader correctly

3. **InteractiveCalendar.tsx** ‚úÖ Already working
   - Uses same `leaves` array
   - Shows all team leaves for context

4. **LeaveBalance.tsx** ‚úÖ Fixed
   - Now refreshes when settings change

## Verification Checklist

Before marking as complete, verify:
- [ ] Leaders see team leaves in Dashboard (Upcoming section)
- [ ] Leaders see team leaves in Dashboard (Recent Activity section)
- [ ] Leaders see team leaves in "All Requests" tab
- [ ] Users see updated balance after changing shift pattern
- [ ] Users see updated balance after changing shift time
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No infinite refresh loops
- [ ] Toast notifications work correctly
