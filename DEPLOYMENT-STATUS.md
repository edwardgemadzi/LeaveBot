# Deployment Status & Network Error Resolution

## Current Situation

You're seeing "Failed to load data" errors in **Users Management** and **Teams Management** because:

1. ✅ **Code is correct** - All API consolidation changes are complete
2. ✅ **Code is pushed** - Latest commit `78d68ed` is on GitHub
3. ❌ **Vercel hasn't deployed yet** - Still serving old API routes

## What Happened

### Before (13 functions - exceeded limit):
```
api/users/index.js
api/users/[id].js
api/users/create.js
api/teams/index.js
api/teams/[id].js
api/teams/[id]/assign.js
api/teams/[id]/remove.js
... (and 6 more)
```

### After (6 functions - under limit):
```
api/users.js          ← Consolidates 3 old endpoints
api/teams.js          ← Consolidates 5 old endpoints
api/leaves.js
api/login.js
api/leaveStats.js
api/teamStats.js
```

### The Problem:
- Your frontend now calls: `/api/users`, `/api/teams`
- Vercel is still serving: `/api/users/index`, `/api/teams/[id]/`, etc.
- Result: 404 Not Found → Network error

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
Vercel should auto-deploy within 2-5 minutes of the push. Check:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your LeaveBot project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for commit: `78d68ed - "Add interactive calendar with date selection"`
5. Wait for deployment to complete (shows green checkmark)

### Option 2: Manual Deploy (If auto-deploy fails)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Trigger Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
4. Check "Use existing Build Cache" (optional)
5. Click "Redeploy"

## Verification Steps

Once deployed, test these in order:

### 1. Check API Routes (Browser DevTools)
Open DevTools → Network tab, then:

**Users Management:**
- Should see: `GET /api/users` → 200 OK
- Should NOT see: `GET /api/users/index` → 404

**Teams Management:**
- Should see: `GET /api/teams` → 200 OK
- Should NOT see: `GET /api/teams/index` → 404

### 2. Test CRUD Operations

**Users:**
- ✅ Load users list
- ✅ Create new user
- ✅ Edit user
- ✅ Delete user
- ✅ Change user password

**Teams:**
- ✅ Load teams list
- ✅ Create new team
- ✅ Edit team
- ✅ Assign user to team
- ✅ Remove user from team
- ✅ Delete team

### 3. Test New Calendar Features

**Interactive Calendar:**
- ✅ Click and drag to select date range
- ✅ Click "+" Request Leave button
- ✅ Verify end date includes last day (visual check)
- ✅ Check pending leaves appear in amber color
- ✅ Test "Show team leaves" toggle (if leader)
- ✅ Verify color coding: green (my), blue (team), amber (pending), red (rejected)

## Expected Timeline

| Time | Status |
|------|--------|
| T+0  | Code pushed to GitHub ✅ |
| T+30s | Vercel detects push ⏳ |
| T+2min | Build starts ⏳ |
| T+3-5min | Deployment completes 🎯 |
| T+5min+ | If still failing, use manual deploy |

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment succeeds but still seeing errors:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Cmd+Shift+R (hard reload)
   - Check "Disable cache" in DevTools

2. **Check API responses:**
   ```bash
   # Test new endpoints (replace with your domain)
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/users
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/teams
   ```

3. **Check Vercel build logs:**
   - Click on deployment in Vercel dashboard
   - Check "Building" tab
   - Look for errors related to missing files

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check build logs for:**
   - Missing dependencies
   - TypeScript errors
   - Import path issues

2. **Verify files exist locally:**
   ```bash
   ls -la api/
   # Should see:
   # users.js (not users/ folder)
   # teams.js (not teams/ folder)
   ```

3. **Check git status:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   # Should see 78d68ed at top
   
   git status
   # Should be clean (no uncommitted changes)
   ```

## Dev Mode Workaround

If you need to test immediately before deployment:

```bash
# Run locally
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test APIs
curl http://localhost:5173/api/users
curl http://localhost:5173/api/teams
```

This works because your local code has the new consolidated APIs.

## Summary

**What's Fixed:**
- ✅ API consolidation (13 → 6 functions)
- ✅ Interactive calendar with date selection
- ✅ Pending leaves now visible on calendar
- ✅ End date highlighting fixed
- ✅ Team view toggle for leaders
- ✅ Color-coded calendar events

**What's Pending:**
- ⏳ Vercel deployment (external - not in your control)

**Next Steps:**
1. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
2. Once deployed, test Users and Teams management
3. Test interactive calendar features
4. Report any issues

**ETA:** Should be working within 5-10 minutes of reading this document.
